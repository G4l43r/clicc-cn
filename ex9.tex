\section{You Learned This}

You learned how to make an empty file.  On Unix \program{touch} does this, and
it also changes the times on the file.  I rarely use it for anything other than
making empty files.  On Windows you don't have this command, so you learned
how to use the \program{New-Item} command, which does the same thing but can
also make new directories.

\section{Do More}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Unix: Make a directory, change to it, and then make a file in it.  Then change
    one level up and run the \program{rmdir} command in this directory.  You
    \emph{should} get an error.  Try to understand why you got this error.
\item Windows: Do the same thing, but you won't get an error.  You'll get a prompt
    asking if you really want to remove the directory.
\end{enumerate}
