\chapter{Making Empty File (touch, EDIT)}

\section{Do This}

\begin{code}{Linux/OSX Exercise 9}
<< d['code/ex9.sh-session|pyg|l'] >>
\end{code}

\begin{code}{Windows Exercise 9}
<< d['code/ex9-win.sh-session|pyg|l'] >>
\end{code}

\section{You Learned This}

You learned how to make an empty file.  On Unix \program{touch} does this, and
it also changes the times on the file.  I rarely use it for anything other than
making empty files.  On Windows you don't have this command, so you learned
how to use the \program{edit} command.  This is a handy little tool for 
quick file editing in PowerShell.

\section{Do More}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a directory, change to it, and then make a file in it.  Then change
    one level up and run the \program{rmdir} command on this directory.  You
    \emph{should} get an error.  Try to explain why you got this error.
\end{enumerate}
