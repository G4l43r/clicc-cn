\chapter{Stream A File (cat)}

You're going to do some more setup for this one so you get used to making files
in one program and then accessing them from the command line.  With the same \emph{text editor} from
Exercise 12, create another file named \file{ex13.txt} but this time save
it directly to your \file{temp} directory.

\section{Do This}

\begin{code}{Linux/Mac OSX Exercise 13}
<< d['code/ex13.sh-session|pyg|l'] >>
\end{code}

\begin{code}{Windows Exercise 13}
<< d['code/ex13-win.sh-session|pyg|l'] >>
\end{code}

Remember that when I say \verb|[displays file here]| I'm abbreviating the output of that command so I don't
have to show you exactly everything.

\section{You Learned This}

Do you like my poem? Totally going to win a Nobel.  Anyway, you already know the first command, and I'm just having you check that your file is there.  Then you \program{cat} the file to the screen.  This command just spews the whole file to the 
screen with no paging or stopping.  To demonstrate that, I have you do this to the
\file{ex12.txt} which should just spew a bunch of lines from that exercise.

\section{Do More}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a few more text files and work with \program{cat}.
\item Unix: Try \verb|cat ex12.txt ex13.txt| and see what it does.
\item Windows: Try \verb|cat ex12.txt,ex13.txt| and see what it does.
\end{enumerate}
