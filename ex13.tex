\chapter{Stream A File (cat)}

You're going to do some more setup for this one so you get used to making files
in one program then accessing them from the command line.  Create another file
named \file{ex13.txt} but this time save it directly to your \file{temp}
directory.


\section{Do This}

\begin{code}{Linux/OSX Exercise 13}
<< d['code/ex13.sh-session|pyg|l'] >>
\end{code}

\begin{code}{Windows Exercise 13}
<< d['code/ex13-win.sh-session|pyg|l'] >>
\end{code}

\section{You Learned This}

Do you like my poem? Totally going to win a Nobel.  Anyway, you already know the first command, and I'm just having you check that your file is there.  Then you \program{cat} the file to the screen.  This command just spews the whole file to the 
screen with no paging or stopping.  To demonstrate that I have you do this to the
\file{ex12.txt} which should just spew a bunch of lines from that exercise.

\section{Do More}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a few more text files and work with \program{cat}.
\item Try \verb|cat ex12.txt ex13.txt| and see what it does.
\end{enumerate}
