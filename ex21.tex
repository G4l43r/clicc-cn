\section{You Learned This}

Your shell has these "hidden variables" that can change how other programs work.
In this exercise I first print out my environment just dumping it to the screen.
Then I do it again but pipe it through \program{grep} to find only the variables
with my username in them.  Finally, I set an environment variable TESTING to "1 2 3".

You may not run into this too often, but sometimes to get something configured
you have to change these.  A good example is the PATH variable, which determines
the search order for other commands.  Changing your PATH is going to be one
of your exercises.


\section{Do More}

\begin{enumerate}
\item I want you to go online and research how you change your PATH for your computer.  Try to do it entirely from the CLI.
\end{enumerate}
