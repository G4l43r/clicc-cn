\section{You Learned This}

Sometimes you forget the name of a command but you know what it does.  This command
looks through all the help files and finds potentially relevant help for you.

Honestly, I only use this out of desperation.  I first go search online and can
usually find a better page describing what I want to do.  If I \emph{still} can't
figure out what the name of that command was then I go through this help list
until I see it.
