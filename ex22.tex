\section{You Learned This}

You can also change an environment variable to something else, as well as
unset them so they aren't in your environment at all.  You can't set an
environment variable to nothing ("") to remove it.  You have to use a 
command.

\section{Do More}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Take and list out all the environment variables you've found and 
    then go lookup what they are online.
\item Read the man page for env again.  What else can it do?
\end{enumerate}
