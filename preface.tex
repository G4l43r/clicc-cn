\chapter*{Preface}

I wrote this book really quick as a way to bootstrap students for my other books.
Many students don't know how to use the basics of the command line interface, and
it was getting in the way of their learning.  This books is designed to be something
they can complete in about a day to a week and then get enough skill at the command
line to then go on to other books.

This book isn't a book about master wizardry system administration.  It's just a quick
introduction to get newbies going.
