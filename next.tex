\chapter{Next Steps}

NOTE: Rough draft until I find something else to say.

You have completed the crash course.  At this point you should be a 
barely capable shell user.  There's a whole huge list of tricks and key
sequences you don't know yet, and I'm going to give you a few final
tricks:

\begin{enumerate}
\item You can type part of a filename and hit TAB to "complete" the potential
    list of available files.
\item You can use your arrow keys to scroll back through the list of commands
    you've already types in.  That's your history.
\item On Unix you can type CTRL-r and get a history search.  \emph{I use this
    all the time!}
\item ...
\end{enumerate}

From now on you shouldn't be afraid of using the command line.  If you are
aspiring to be a programmer, it is the best first step to understand how
a computer is a "language machine".  The shell is a lot like a tiny little
programming language that most people can get easily.

Finally, if you want to really learn more about how to be awesome
with the shell, go read TODO.
