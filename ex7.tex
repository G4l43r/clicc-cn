\section{You Learned This}

I'm now mixing up the commands so make sure you type them exactly and pay attention.
Every time you make a mistake, it's because you aren't paying attention.  If you
find yourself making many mistakes, then take a break or just quit for the day.
You've always got tomorrow to try again.

In this example you learn how to remove a directory.  It's easy you just
go to the directory right above it, then type \verb|rmdir DIR| replacing "DIR"
with the name of the directory to remove.

\section{Do More}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make 20 more directories and remove them all.
\item Make a single path of directories that is 10 deep and remove them one at a
    time just like I did above.
\end{enumerate}
