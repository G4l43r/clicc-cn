\section{You Learned This}

You're now getting into programmer territory with this command but it's so
handy I have to teach it to you.  These commands let you temporarily go
to a different directory and then come back, or easily switch between
two.

The \program{pushd} command takes your current directory and "pushes" it
onto a list for later, then it \emph{changes} to another directory.  It's
like saying, "Save where I am then go here."

The \program{popd} command takes the last directory you pushed and "pops"
it off, taking you back there.

Finally, \program{pushd} if you run it by itself with no arguments will
switch between your current directory and the last one you pushed.  It's
an easy way to switch between two directories.

\section{Do More}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use these commands to move around directories all over your
    computer.
\item Remove the \file{i/like/icecream} directories and make your own, then
    move around in them.
\item Explain to yourself the output that \program{pushd} and \program{popd}
    print out to you.  Notice how it works like a stack?
\end{enumerate}
