\section{You Learned This}

Sometimes you want to do a command to a set of files all at once.  The way you do
this is to use the \verb|*| (asterisk) symbol to say "anything".  Wherever you
put the asterisk will be ignored and the shell will build a list of all the files
that match the non-asterisk part.

In this exercise you list out various files that you've made so far.  I have a
few extra that were hanging out in my directory, and you might have others.  The
key is by writing \verb|*.txt| you are saying "anything ending in .txt".

At the end we use \verb|rm *.txt| to remove all of the .txt files in the
\file{temp} directory.

\section{Do More}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Add the \verb|*| to your deck of flash cards.  On the back write "match anything in a wildcard like *.txt".
\end{enumerate}
