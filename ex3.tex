\section{Do This}

\begin{code}{Linux/Mac OSX Exercise 3}
<< d['code/ex3.sh-session|pyg|l'] >>
\end{code}

\begin{code}{Windows Exercise 3}
<< d['code/ex3-win.sh-session|pyg|l'] >>
\end{code}

People on Windows XP don't have this command.  In fact, you should upgrade
if you are on Windows XP. But, in the meantime, you can try this:

\begin{code}{Windows XP Alternative whoami}
<< d['code/ex3-winxp.sh-session|pyg|l'] >>
\end{code}

If you're on Window XP then you probably won't need this command, so don't
worry that the above seems weird.  It's just an exercise.

\section{Do More}

Windows XP people can skip this do more unless you really want to practice.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Just like the last exercise, type this command 20 times and say it out loud.
\end{enumerate}
