\section{You Learned This}

You just learned how to find out what your "user name" is.  This is what
you used to log into your computer, and it's important to know it.  Why?
Because your computer has security restrictions that depend on what user
you are.  Also because I told you it's important.

\section{Do More}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Type \program{whoami} 20 times.
\item type \program{pwd} and \program{whoami} 20 times.
\item No, seriously I'm not going to tell you again to just do it.
\end{enumerate}
