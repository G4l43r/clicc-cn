\chapter{Change Directory (cd)}

\section{Do This}

I'm going to give you the instructions for these sessions one more time:

\begin{enumerate} 
\item You do \emph{not} type in the \verb|$| (unix) or \verb|>| (Windows).
\item You type in the stuff after this, then hit enter.  If I have \verb|$ cd temp| you type just \verb|cd temp| and hit enter.
\item The output comes after you hit enter, followed by another \verb|$| or \verb|>| prompt.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{code}{Linux/OSX Exercise 5}
\begin{Verbatim}
<< d['code/ex5.sh-session'] >>
\end{Verbatim}
\end{code}

\begin{code}{Windows Exercise 5}
\begin{Verbatim}
<< d['code/ex5-win.sh-session'] >>
\end{Verbatim}
\end{code}

\section{You Learned This}

You are now changing into directories using paths.  You made all these directories
in the last exercise, and now you're just moving around inside them with the
\program{cd} command.  In my session above I also use \program{pwd} to check
where I am, so remember, you don't type the output that \program{pwd} prints.
For example, on line 3 you see \verb|~/temp| but that's the output of \program{pwd}
from the prompt above it.  \emph{Do not type this in}.

You should also see how I use the \verb|..| to move "up" in the tree and path.

\section{Do More}

\begin{enumerate}
\item cd to the \file{joe} directory with one command.
\item cd back to \file{temp} with one command, but not further above that.
\item Find out how to cd to your home directory with one command.
\end{enumerate}
