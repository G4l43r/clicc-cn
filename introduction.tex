\chapter*{Introduction: Shut Up And Shell}

This book is a crash course in using the command line to make your computer do things.
As a crash course, it's not as detailed or extensive as my other books.  It is simply
designed to get you barely capable enough to start using your computer like a real
programmer does.  When you're done with it, you will be able to give most of the
basic commands that every shell user touches every day.  You'll understand the basics
of directories and a few other concepts.

The only piece of advice I am going to give you is this:

\begin{quote}
Shut the hell up and type this in then try to understand it.
\end{quote}

Sorry to be mean, but that's what you have to do.  You have an irrational fear
of the command line and the only way to conquer an irrational fear is to just
shut up and fight through it.

You are not going to destroy your computer.  You are not going to be thrown
into some jail at the bottom of Microsoft's Redmond campus.  Your freinds
won't laugh at you for being a nerd.  Simply ignore any stupid weird reasons you have
for fearing the command line.

Why?  Because if you want to learn to code, then you must learn this.  Programming
languages are advanced ways to control your computer with language.  The command line
is the baby little brother of programming languages.  They teach you to control the
computer using language.  Once you get past that, you can then move on to writing
code and feeling like you actually own the hunk of metal you just bought.

So, shut up and learn the shell.
