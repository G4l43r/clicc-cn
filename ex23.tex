\section{You Learned This}

Your final exercise is how to exit a terminal.  Again this is very easy, but
I'm going to have you do more.

\section{Do More}

For your last set of exercises I'm going to have you use the help system to look up
a set of commands you should research and learn how to use on your own.

Here's the list for Unix:

\begin{enumerate}
\item xargs
\item sudo
\item chmod
\item chown
\item ...
\end{enumerate}


For Windows look up these things:

\begin{enumerate}
\item forfiles
\item runas
\item attrib
\item icacls
\item ...
\end{enumerate}

Find out what these are, play with them, and then add them to your index cards.
