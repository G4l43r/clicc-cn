\chapter{Removing A File (rm)}

\section{Do This}

\begin{code}{Linux/OSX Exercise 14}
<< d['code/ex14.sh-session|pyg|l'] >>
\end{code}

\begin{code}{Windows Exercise 14}
<< d['code/ex14-win.sh-session|pyg|l'] >>
\end{code}

\section{You Learned This}

Here we clean up the files from the last exercise.  Remember when I had you
try to \program{rmdir} on a directory with something in it?  Well that failed
because you can't remove a directory with stuff in it.  To do that you have
to remove the file, or recursively delete it.  That's what you did at the
end of this.

\section{Do More}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Clean up everything in \file{temp} from all the exercises so far.
\item Write in your notebook that you have to be careful when running recursive
    remove on files.
\end{enumerate}
